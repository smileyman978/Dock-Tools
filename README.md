# Dock Tools
A tool for the Steam Deck to allow for further customization of the docked experience.

# Overview
I initially came up with the idea for this tool and project after realizing just how limited the settings were for the docked Steam Deck experience. Only being able to adjust the refresh rate of an external monitor, and nothing else. In comparison to Windows, the limitations are vast. My goal is to bring a conscise and easy to use tool that allows for further customization of the refresh rate, frame rate, brightness, resolution & more, within game mode.

## Update
I am currently in the process of developing this project, and plan to keep this section as updated as possible as I work on this. I'm doing this between my job, and also running a business, so it may take some time to get updates, but it will be worth the wait.
